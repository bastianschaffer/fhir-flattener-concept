- view definitions for slices can only be generated if all slices are known and can be looked up
- note that the server crashes with viewDefinition-2 when there are multiple codings of the same system


- if there is a binding: *ignore* other systems
- if there is a pattern and a binding: write the pattern as explicit column and another column for fields that are not equal to the pattern (see condition-slice/viewDefinition-3.json)
- if nothing is defined then: create a column 'system' and 'code' and do forEach
